# Learning C

Each branch corresponds to a video from a [series of tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90hGCMC3Chc&list=PLrSOXFDHBtfEh6PCE39HERGgbbaIHhy4j) 
available on youtube and created by a french guy.

This repository will be updated with descriptive comment lines
to learn how to code and learn C easily.

Each C lesson will be accompanied by an emoji to distinguish them.

The ultimate goal is for me to be able to create my own working Snake game.

## How to start a C project?
- To start a C project, you need at LEAST this code:
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("Hello world");
    return 0;
}
```
