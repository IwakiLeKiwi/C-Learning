# Character strings

The eleventh lesson is about strings.

Character strings are arrays containing characters.

To declare a ``SINGLE`` character:
```
char letter = 'A';
```

To declare a string of ``SEVERAL`` characters:
```
char letters[] = 'Hello world';
```

You can give a predefined number of characters to your string, but you must always add one more!
```
char string[7] = "Hello";
```

In 'Hello' there are ``6`` characters but in the string we add one more because for each end of the string there is a character added automatically: ``'\0'`` (And it needs a place in the string).
