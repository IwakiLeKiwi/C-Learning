# 4-Conditions
The fourth lesson deals with conditions.

There are a few conditions:
        <br>``==`` : equal to
        <br>``!=`` : different from
        <br>``<`` : less than
        <br>``>`` : greater than
        <br>``<=`` : smaller than or equal to
        <br>``>=`` : greater than or equal to
        <br>``&&`` : and
        <br>``||`` : or
        <br>``!``  not

You can use ``if()`` to give a condition, as well as ``switch`` or``terner``.
